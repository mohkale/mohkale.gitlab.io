Well, the end has come. 2020 has been a **chaotic, hectic, messy year**.
The dominating topic of discussion for this year was, and will continue to be, the
[novel Corona-Virus][cv]. With over 83 million worldwide recorded cases and almost 2
million deaths, this pandemic will regrettably be remembered as the defining marker to
the entrance of the 2020s.

This year has tested all of our collective patience. With lock-downs lasting the
majority of it and an entire political divide forming between those who want a
prompt return to normalcy and those advocating caution and patience to avoid
exacerbating the ongoing pandemic. I'd be remiss not to mention the complete absurdity
of the American governments [response][cv-america] to the pandemic (spearheaded by a
~~disgraceful~~ President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)).
Most recently there've been reports about a [mutant][cv-mutant] strain of the virus
continuing to run rampant despite recent [public vaccinations][cv-vaccine].

On some level I think we all underestimated the very immeadiate and long-lasting
consequences of Covid. I remember late last year (perhaps November) one of my
lecturers made a joke about how hot the room was and whether it was worth risking
opening the windows, for fear the virus may leak in. This was back at the very
beginning when the pandemic was still isolated to China and many of us took it as a
far-off hypothetical. Not soon after that it *became reality* for myself and many
others. Halfway into the 2020 spring semester in-person lectures were suspended,
assignments were delayed and module-leads rushed to switch to online-teaching and
setup digital assessments for the remainder of the semester. It wasn't perfect but I
suppose we all endured. The expectation was that everything would be fine by the next
semester but **it wasn't and it still isn't**. Everyone collectively just seems to be
hoping everything will be back to normal soon, and that *hope* (I suppose) is dulling
our effectiveness at solving the onslaught of new issues. I have little more to say about
Corona-Virus. This post isn't to discuss the ramifications of it, although I'd be
lying if I said 2020 as a whole wasn't defined by this pandemic.

In other news 2020 is the first year since I began writing this blog :joy:. My
intentions were just to have a place that I could jot down my thoughts and
recollections. I keep actual study notes in an [org-brain][org-roam] in
[Dropbox][dropbox] and at some point I may link it to this blog like the venorable
[Jethro Kuan][jethro-brain].
To date I've only written around 6 posts. Early into the year I started applying for
new-grad roles and so my initial focus of writing about my thoughts and opinions
switched to dogmatically studying data-structures, algorithms and solving extensive
[leet-code][exercises] problems. I also directed what free time I could muster into
working on more [personal][puddle] projects, the kinds that let me learn new
technologies and frameworks. Luckily my devotion payed off and I managed to get into
the [Bloomberg Engineering Graduate][bloomberg-newgrad] scheme in London. By the time
of my 2021 year in review I'll hopefully be 2 months into my stay at Bloomberg and
have much more hopeful things to talk about.

2020 hasn't been the worst year ever. It's just the most memorable one I've had to
date and hopefully it'll stay that way, lest something worse lie on the horizon.
It's been a long ride and I hope 2021 will be a considerable improvement for everyone;
I leave you with my inspirational quote of the year.

{{< quote src="Simone Biles" cite="Simone Biles, Athlete" >}}
I'd rather regret the risks that didn't work out than the chances I didn't take at all.

## Stray Events
- I switched from Windows to Linux ([Arch][arch] btw) as my main desktop OS. I had been using
  it on my laptop since early last year however now I'm using Linux exclusively and loving it
  :heart:.
- [The Queen's Gambit][queens-gambit] starring ([Anya Taylor Joy][anya-tj]) took
  the world by storm.
- [The Promised Neverland][promised-neverland] manga reached a rushed, albeit
  enjoyable conclusion.
- The [Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai][benkyou] manga took a somewhat refreshing approach to
  harem style series and reached a satisfying and enjoyable end.
- [One Piece][op] finally reached chapter 1000 :sunglasses:, only 10 times as many
  left before it finishes :tada:.
- The long awaited sequel to the unexpectedly decent [Wonder Woman][ww] movie,
  [Wonder Woman 1984][ww1984] flopped... HARD!.
