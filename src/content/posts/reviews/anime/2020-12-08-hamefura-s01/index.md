introduction: |-
  I've recently been going through the backlog of anime I've been meaning to watch
  (only around 200 left (￣□￣；)). And I chanced upon this relatively new series
  from earlier in the year that I actually enjoyed more than I thought I would.

## Introduction
Hamefura is a generic wholesome harem anime with isekai and romcom tropes. We're
introduced to the protagonist, Katerina Claes as young girl entering her first year
at a magical school, before a flashback immediately takes us back to her as young
child.

Boisterous and spoiled, she's introduced as the only daughter of an affluent family
who wants for nothing. One day while on a walk with a prince she trips and has an
awakening. She remembers her past life as a *normal* high school girl who enjoyed
playing  otome games\*. She then realises that she's in one of those games
right now... and she's the **villainess** (・｀ω´・).

The first of many twists, the series introduces our character as the antagonist. She
has memories of how her story will unfold, {{< spoiler >}}ending with the *protagonist*
taking her fiance and her being exiled far away{{</ spoiler >}}. The series then
proceeds with her trying to piece together how her story will develop and trying to
prevent the absolute worst, **doom**, ending.

## Story & Character
{{< figure src="ep05-00_03_59.jpg" class="full-width-when-small  right inline clamp-width" width="300px" >}}

A key theme throughout the story is that the capture targets from the original game
will all end up tied to Katerina in one way or another. The prince, Gerald Stuart,
with whom she was walking felt guilty about her accident and proposed. Katerina
becomes close friends with Mary Hunt whose engaged to the princes brother, Alan
Stuart, another capture target. Keith Claes is a distant relative of Katerina who
ends up becoming her adopted brother, he's yet another capture target. Lastly
Katerina befriends Sophia Ascart ({{< spoiler >}}A girl who it's later revealed is
also someone Katerina knew from a past life{{< /spoiler >}}) whose brother, Nicole
Ascart is the final capture target.

By the end of episode 3, the flashback sequence is over and all the main characters
and their dynamics have been established (excluding the protaganist *Maria Cambell*).
Surprisingly enough all of these characters have, in one form or another, developed a
positive relationship with Katerina. All the capture targets are in love with her.
Even her close friend Mary loves her; and comedically prevents her fiance Alan
from realising his love so as to diminish her own rival count. Katerina, despite being
a voracious otome game player is completely oblivious to this. Partially because
knowing this would sap the driving goal of the narrative. If everyone loves her,
they won't turn against her in the bad end. But more so because knowing would harm
the group dynamic.

Throughout the series, Katarina also escapes into a sort of mental conference. The
metaphorical pause state of the game. She goes to speak to her conflicted
personalities and deliberate on her next course of action. Honestly I found this to
be the funniest part of the series. It reiterates how little actual tension there is
about Caterina's demise. The heartfelt and comedic undertones of the show never fail
to put one at ease. In that regards the series is almost like a *slice of life* show;
in the vein of KonoSuba.

## Conclusions
I found Hamefura to be an amusing if *lack-luster* series.
The characters all fall into some sort of a classic trope and there's next to no
character development. Everyone seems to be introduced to fulfil some role in the
narrative and beyond that they seem to exist simply as remnants of that
plot-point.
Given that Katerina has no chance of actually being a villain the story veers into
developments with other characters trying to wrongfully vilify her but through her
oblivious and somewhat blunt nature any claim that she's some sort of mad-genius just
fall flat.
The art and animation of the show is well done, not immaculate like the Monogatari
series or Attack on Titans numerous Levi scenes but satisfactory for what amounts to
be a comedic slice-of-life series.
All in all I'd recommend Hamefura and should a second season come out I'll most
likely watch it but I see little merit in re-watching the first season.

\**otome games* - visual novels targeted towards women. mostly consisting of a single
heroine trying to conquer one (or more) possible targets (quite often men).
