challenge: |-
  You are given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers. Arrays A and B
  represent N voracious fish in a river, ordered downstream along the flow of the river.

  The fish are numbered from 0 to $$N-1$$. If P and Q are two fish and $$P &lt; Q$$,
  then fish P is initially upstream of fish Q. Initially, each fish
  has a unique position.

  Fish number P is represented by $$A[P]$$ and $$B[P]$$. Array A contains the
  sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique. Array B contains the
  directions of the fish. It contains only 0s and/or 1s, where:
  - 0 represents a fish flowing upstream
  - 1 represents a fish flowing downstream

  If two fish move in opposite directions and there are no other (living)
  fish between them, they will eventually meet each other. Then only one
  fish can stay alive âˆ’ the larger fish eats the smaller one. More precisely,
  we say that two fish P and Q meet each other when $$P &lt; Q$$, $$B[P] = 1$$
  and $$B[Q] = 0$$, and there are no living fish between them. After they meet:

  - If $$A[P] > A[Q]$$ then P eats Q, and P will still be flowing downstream,
  - If $$A[Q] > A[P]$$ then Q eats P, and Q will still be flowing upstream.

  We assume that all the fish are flowing at the same speed. That is,
  fish moving in the same direction never meet. The goal is to calculate
  the number of fish that will stay alive.

  For example, consider arrays A and B such that:

  ```text
  A[0] = 4    B[0] = 0
  A[1] = 3    B[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2    B[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1    B[3] = 0
  A[4] = 5    B[4] = 0
  ```

  Initially all the fish are alive and all except fish number 1 are
  moving upstream. Fish number 1 meets fish number 2 and eats it, then
  it meets fish number 3 and eats it too. Finally, it meets fish number
  4 and is eaten by it. The remaining two fish, number 0 and 4, never
  meet and therefore stay alive.

  def solution(fish, direction):
    stack = []
    count = 0

    for i in range(len(fish)):
      if direction[i] == 1:
        stack.append(i)
      else:
        # continually feed previous fish to current fish
        while len(stack) > 0 and fish[stack[-1]] < fish[i]:
          stack.pop()
        if len(stack) == 0: # current fish won
          count += 1
    return count + len(stack)

  The thing to notice about this problem is that the fish are flowing in two
  directions and fish we encounter later into the array have a higher intersection
  precedence compare to fish earlier in the array. For example:

  ```text
  2~> 3~> <~1 <~5
  ```

  In this sequence there's two fishes with values 2 and 3 and opposing fishes
  with values 1 and 5. The last fish we encounter before meeting the fish with
  value 1 is 3, they collide and fish 1 is eaten. Then fish 5 eats fish 3,
  followed by eating fish 2 as well. The only surviving fish left is 5. And the
  function returns 1.

  The idea here is that opposing fish come in a stream, with the most recent fish
  being at the top of the stream. When the fish encounters an opponent, that fish,
  and each fish before, it is considered until either the incoming fishes overpower
  the current fish or all incoming fishes are eaten.

  We can represent this **LAST-IN FIRST-OUT** relationship using a stack. When we
  encounter a fish going in one direction, we add it to the stack as part of the
  stream. When we encounter a fish going in the opposite direction, we run through the
  stack until either the stack is exhausted or we find a fish that overpowers the
  current fish. If the stack is exhausted, we increment a counter to indicate that
  the current fish survived its journey.

  The final survived fish is count is the sum of the stack and this counter.
