        Multiple small to medium scale roles over the past few years:
        - Taught **python** fundamentals to a someone unfamiliar with CS, later bringing them up to speed and
          collaborating with them on the creation of a **flask** web application
        - Created a web scraper using **scrapy** and deployed it to a **VPS** to periodically fetch updates
        - Used **selenium** to scrape dynamically generated content on a **GraphQL** backed web-app

        #### Year 01
        - Teamed up with 2 others to create a maze traversal algorithm for a robot in java
          - Ranked in the **top 3** of solutions for the entire year group
        - Coordinated a team of 7 on the creation of a **web platform** for a twitter based taxi service
          - Oversaw interaction with the repository and created scripts to **automate content generation**.
          - Lead development on our **backend twitter connection**; including an **asynchronous** update system
            which kept the backend and frontend **states** in sync.

        #### Year 02
        - Built on earlier work by learning **stochastic** approaches to solving **intractable** problems
        - Created an **OCR** system, using **Numpy** and **Pillow**, to read text from images
          - Included word **auto-correction algorithm** and reached an accuracy of **82%**
        - Learnt functional programming by developing an **emulator** for the Enigma Machine in **haskell**.
        - Worked on a maze traversal algorithm using **ROS** (the Robot Operating System).
