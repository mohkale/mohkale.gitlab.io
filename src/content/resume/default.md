      subtitle: A 2D game project written with C# and monogame
      body: |-
        - Developed from scratch using core drawing primitives offered by the **Monogame** API
        - Basic **physics engine** and **collision handling** implemented using custom code
        - Created a **WinForms** based level editor to simplify level generation

        Multiple small to medium scale roles over the past few years:
        - Taught python fundamentals to a someone unfamilliar with CS and collaborated with them on
          the creation of a **flask** web application
        - Created a web scraper using **scrapy** and deployed it to a **remote server** to periodically
          scrape new data
        - Used **selenium** to scrape dynamically generated content on a modern **GraphQL** backed web
          application
        - Populated an **excel** table using data fetched from multiple API endpoints

        #### Year 01
        - Teamed up with 2 others to create a maze traversal algorithm for a robot in java
          - Ranked in the **top 3** of solutions for the entire year group
        - Worked collaboratively with a team of 7 to create a **web platform** for a twitter based taxi service
          - I oversaw team interaction with the repository and created scripts to **automate content generation**.
          - I also lead development on our **backend twitter connection**; including an **asynchronous** update system
            that lazily read incoming requests and synced both backend and frontend **states**.

        #### Year 02
        - Built on earlier work by learning **stochastic** approaches to solving **intractable** problems
        - Created an **OCR** system, using **Numpy** and **Pillow**, to read words from images passed through
          progressively noisier filters
          - Included word **auto-correction algorithm** and worked to an accuracy of **82%** (on average).
        - Learnt functional programming by developing an **emulator** for the Enigma Machine in **haskell**.
        - Worked on a maze traversal algorithm using **ROS** (the Robot Operating System).
