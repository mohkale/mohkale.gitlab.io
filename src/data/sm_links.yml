# links shown when supported.
#
# This file should be an array of configuration options for a displayed link.
#
# There are three types of links, links to a page which you can find at runtime,
# links to an entry in the `contact' section of our site params and literal links
# to fixed URLs. The former requires `key' argument, the second latter requires a
# link argument and the last just requires a `link' field.
#
# there's also a variant of `page' links of type RSS which're the same as `page'
# except they permalink to the "RSS" output format.
#
# Each link can also specify a for:
# * title
# * class
# * fontawesome [1]
#
# [1]: which has to be a hash that can be passed to the utils/fontawesome partial.
