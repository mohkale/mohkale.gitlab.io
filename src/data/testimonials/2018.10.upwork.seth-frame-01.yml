    I need a programmer to write a script (preferably Python) that
    will take a list of URLs and check them in the database website
    Crunchbase, and then check if they have recieved funding. It would
    be great if it would also check if the company is headquartered in
    a specific country (that info is also on crunchbase).

    It will then need to input that information back into excel.

    Mohsin did everything perfectly and was great at communicating
    with me. It's always nice to work with native English speakers as
    well. He wrote the program quickly and helped me set everything up
    once it was written. Grade A work.
